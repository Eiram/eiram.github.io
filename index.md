# Artifact Evaluation

 All artifacts are evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee. Each artifact will be reviewed by at least two committee members. Reviewers will read the accepted paper and explore the artifact to evaluate how well the artifact supports the claims and results of the paper. The evaluation is based on the following questions.

* Is the artifact consistent with the paper and the claims made by the paper?
* Are the results of the paper replicable through the artifact?
* Is the artifact complete, i.e., how many of the results of the paper are replicable?
* Is the artifact well-documented?
* Is the artifact easy to use?

The artifact evaluation is performed in the following two phases.
## Test Phase 
In the test phase, reviewers check if the artifact is functional, i.e., they look for setup problems (e.g., corrupted, missing files, crashes on simple examples, etc.). If any problems are detected, the authors are informed of the outcome and asked for clarification.  

To this end, a github repository will be used, where discovered issues are communicated with the issue and a first notification is given to the authors at 17.01, who then have 5 days to solve the problems and answer to the respective issue. Reviewers and authors are encouraged to use these 5 days for further clarifying comments. 

Github will *not* be used to upload the artifact itself.
    
## Assessment Phase
In the assessment phase, reviewers will try to reproduce any experiments or activities and evaluate the artifact w.r.t the questions detailed above.

## Awarding
FASE awards the [evaluation and availability badges of EAPLS](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/). 
 * The availability badge will be awarded if the artifact is publically available and has a DOI. We recommend services like [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [figshare](figshare.com) for this.
 * The evaluation badge has two levels, functional and reusable. Each successfully evaluated artifact receives at least the functional bade. The reusable badge is granted to artifacts of very high quality. Authors may use all granted badges on the title page of the respective paper. Detailed guidelines for both levels is described [here](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/).

Availability and evaluation badges are awareded independent of each other.
